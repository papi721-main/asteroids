# 🚀 Asteroids

My second project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)!

Relive the golden age of arcades with **Asteroids**, a lightweight and beginner-friendly Python remake of the iconic space shooter game. Built with `pygame`, this project lets you pilot a spaceship, dodge asteroids, and blast your way through space with fast-paced gameplay and retro charm.

## 🎮 Game Features

- 🚀 **Spaceship Controls**: Rotate, thrust, and fire your way through space.
- 🪨 **Dynamic Asteroids**: Randomly generated and moving obstacles that get in your way.
- 💥 **Collision Detection**: Shoot asteroids to destroy them before they crash into you.
- 🔁 **Game Loop**: Smooth handling of player actions, object updates, and screen refresh.
- 🎓 **Educational**: Great for beginners learning object-oriented programming and game design.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library

Install dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Play

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
```sh
git clone https://github.com/papi721-main/asteroids.git cd asteroids
```

2. **Run the game**:
    
```sh
python3 main.py
# or simply
# ./main.py
```

3. **Controls**:

| Key      | Action          |
| -------- | --------------- |
| w        | Thrust Forward  |
| s        | Thrust Backward |
| a        | Rotate Left     |
| d        | Rotate Right    |
| Spacebar | Fire Bullet     |

4. **Objective**:

  - Destroy asteroids to survive and score points. Avoid crashing — one hit and it’s game over!

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This game was built as a hands-on way to practice:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Real-time event handling and user input
- Collision mechanics and sprite behavior
- Using `pygame` for graphics, sound, and animation
